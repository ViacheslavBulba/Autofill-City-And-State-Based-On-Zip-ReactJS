# Project Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The goal of this small project was to implement state and city lookup based on zip provided. The solution uses a hardcoded json with data (zip - state - city mapping) without using an external API for simplicity.
